To calculate the Audio Aura or a specific listener taking the 100 most listened songs of said user, I would implement a function
that uses a formula to determine the Aura's vaue. Said formula`s output would be the average between the energy, valence, and
danceability of the user`s top 100 songs from the past year. The formula would look something like this:
Audio_Aura = average(avg(energy), avg(valence), avg(danceability))
Where avg(parameter) equals the average value of said parameter of the top 100 songs of the user

This way of calculating the Aura of a user may be misleading due to the lack of diversity in the parameters, which are only three.
To improve the Audio Aura's approximation, we could implement all the values that a song has. The result value of this calculation
would be useful in other field related ot the user`s experience such as songs recommentations.
